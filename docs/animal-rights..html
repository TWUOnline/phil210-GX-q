<h2>Overview<a href="animal-rights..html#overview-4" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>Welcome to Unit 5!</p>
<p>Do animals have rights? We commonly speak of humans having rights, but animals? Could it be that your pet cat, or dog, or the local farmerâs livestock, or even animals living in the wild, have rights to certain things? This question has been a point of intense discussion in the past few decades and it is the focus of this unit. When we ask if animals have rights, we are really asking whether animals are the kinds of beings that could have rights. Of course, we cannot answer that question without having some idea of what kinds of beings have rights in the first place. If we can provide an answer to this question, then we will be well on our way to knowing whether animals have rights. The question of whether animals have rights leads directly to a more foundational one, namely, what it means to attribute a right to a being, whether it be a human or an animal? What are we saying when we affirm that someone has a right to something?</p>
<p>A <strong>right</strong> is one of the strongest entities of which one could speak in both legal and moral discourse. It conveys the idea of being entitled to something. If a person does not receive something to which they have a right, then a wrong has been done. Their rights have been violated. This means that to affirm that one has a right to something is to make a forceful statement and one that carries implications for other people.</p>
<p><strong>Legal rights,</strong> such as the right to live free of a home invasion, are declared and enforced by governments. If someone violates your legal rights by breaking into your home and robbing you at gun point, that person violates this legal right of yours. He has acted illegally and, consequently, if caught, will be subject to a penalty from the government.</p>
<p>In this unit, we are primarily concerned with moral rights rather than legal ones. <strong>Moral rights</strong> exist whether or not they are declared, recognized, or enforced by governments. Of course, there is often debate about whether something actually is a moral right, but few people disagree that moral rights exist. To have a moral right to something, say a right to live free of harm from others, means one is entitled to live without being attacked by others in oneâs society regardless of whether the law requires it or not. If your neighbour attacks you in front of your home, then a moral wrong has been done since you did not receive something to which you had a moral right, namely an existence free of harm from others.</p>
<p>We can take this one step further. If you have a moral right to something, say to live in safety, it also means that someone somewhere, in this case other members of your society, have a corresponding <strong>moral duty</strong> to honour that right by not causing you harm. If they do, then they have not fulfilled their moral duty to you. They have acted immorally.</p>
<p>It should be obvious that the way we answer our original question of whether animals have rights will have a far-reaching implication for us. If we affirm that animals do have rights, it will mean that we have corresponding duties to treat them in certain ways and, in fact, are acting immorally if we do not treat them in these ways. We may prefer to deny that animals have rights in order to relieve ourselves of our duties toward them. Our desire to avoid moral duties, however, will not count as a legitimate reason for a no-animal-rights position because moral rights, by their nature, are not things we simply decide to confer upon others. Thatâs how legal rights work, but not moral rights. Moral rights are entities we simply recognize or discover.</p>
<p>If animals do have rights, then a few other questions immediately follow. Which animals, what rights, and how did they get them? What is the basis for believing such rights exist? To answer this, we could ask how we, as humans, âgetâ the rights we say we have, rights to such things as life and liberty. Legal rights come from the government, but from where do we derive moral rights? Answering this question will inevitably lead to the question of what kinds of beings have rights. A more technical way of asking this is: <strong>What are the ârights-giving characteristicsâ which any being who has rights possesses, and do any animals possess these characteristics?</strong> This, then, becomes one of the key questions for us to explore. Answering it will help us determine whether a particular animal has rights. Different answers have been given to this query and we will see three very different ones in the readings for this unit. We will have an opportunity to examine and evaluate the basis for different perspectives regarding our duties to animals with our class colleagues.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Are Animals Self-Aware?<a href="animal-rights..html#are-animals-self-aware" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The first answer concerning animal rights that we will consider is given by the eighteenth century German philosopher, Immanuel Kant, who believed animals do not have rights. Interestingly he tied his answer directly to the question of what kinds of being have rights. In order to have a right, says Kant, a being must be self-conscious, or in other words, self-aware. Since he believed animals do not have this characteristic, they cannot possess rights. As we read his article, we will want to note carefully how he arrived at these two conclusions, first, that a key rights-giving characteristic of any being is self-consciousness (sometimes referred to as self-awareness), and secondly, that animals do not possess this characteristic. Letâs suppose, for purposes of argument, that Kant was correct. What does this mean, then, for the way we should treat animals? One might think that if animals have no rights, as Kant argued, that we are free to treat them in just any old way. We may be surprised at Kantâs answer to this question but it is one to which we will also want to pay special attention. Once we understand it, we will be in a position to see if we agree with it.</p>

<p>The second answer to our question about animal rights could hardly be more different from Immanuel Kantâs. It comes from well-known American ethicist, Peter Singer, who argued that animals do, indeed, have rights, in the same strong sense as we humans have them. Furthermore, since animals have rights, it means that many of our current practices involving animals are actually immoral. They violate the rights of animals. In fact, Singer went so far as to argue that the very principle of equality which we apply to humans should be extended to many animals as well. When we restrict this principle to humans, he said, we are guilty of something he called <strong>speciesism.</strong> While this term may be new to us, it is one we will want to understand clearly when we read his article. It is akin to the terms, racism and sexism, which refer to practices which are immoral because they violate the principle of equality. Speciesism, said Singer, also violates this principle and, for this reason, is immoral as well. As we read through Singerâs article, weâll want to see precisely what he meant by the term, speciesism, and how he reasoned to his conclusion that animals have rights in this strong sense.</p>

<p>The third answer to our question about animal rights comes from American English professor, Roger Scruton, and could be summed up as the, âAnimals-do-not-have-rights-but. . .â position. They do not have rights, says Scruton, for the simple reason that they are not the kinds of beings that possess rights. Notice that in saying this, Scruton, like Kant, is grounding his view on animal rights directly in the question of the kind of beings which have rights.</p>
<p>What kinds of beings, then, do have rights? Scrutonâs answer is that <strong>persons</strong> have rights while <strong>nonpersons</strong> do not. But what, precisely, does it mean to be a person? It means, he says, that one has the distinguishing features of personhood which include such things as self-awareness, the power of reason, personality, etc. Persons are capable of entering into ongoing dialogue with other persons. To state this more technically, personhood is the chief rights-giving characteristic.</p>
<p>Scruton also introduces the term <strong>moral community.</strong> This refers to a group of persons who have both moral rights and also corresponding moral duties to each other. Again, they have these because they are the types of beings which are capable of having such rights and duties, namely, persons. Animals, on the other hand, are not members of moral communities since they do not have these characteristics.
As we read Scrutonâs article, we will want to ask, however, if he has left open the possibility that there could be exceptions to his principle. What would happen, for example, if we discovered animals that did appear to have these rights-giving characteristics, self-awareness, reason, personality, etc.? Might they be persons? If so, would we need to regard them as having rights and duties and, thus, as being members of a moral community?</p>
<p>Regardless of how we answer that question, we will also want to pay special heed to the question of how animals should be treated if they really have no rights, as Scruton argues. Itâs the same question we asked for Immanuel Kantâs view. If they have no rights, does this mean that any treatment of them at all is morally permissible? Interestingly, Scrutonâs answer is, no. He argues that we still have moral duties to animals even though these duties are not grounded in any rights possessed by the animals. On what, then, are they grounded?</p>
<p>We will want to take special note of Scrutonâs reasoning and learn on what he is grounding our duties to animals. If they are not grounded on any rights possessed by the animals, then where do our duties come from? Once we grasp his answer to this question, we will be in a position to assess the basis he provides for our duties toward animals.</p>

<h2>Unit 5 Summary<a href="animal-rights..html#unit-5-summary" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>In this unit, weâll be turning our attention to animal rights, an issue which has been the subject of intense discussion and disagreement around the world in recent years. A right is one of the strongest entities one could speak of in both moral and legal discourse and we commonly speak of humans having them. Our question in this unit, however, is whether your pet cat, or dog, or the local farmerâs livestock, or even animals living in the wild, might actually have rights to certain things too? When we ask if animals have rights, we are really asking whether they are the kinds of beings that could have rights. This, in turn, leads to two further questions: what kinds of beings have rights in the first place, and what does it mean to attribute a right to a being, whether it be human or animal? These are the questions weâll explore in this unit.</p>
